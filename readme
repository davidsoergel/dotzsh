Lorax zsh config files
======================

.zshrc files should generally go in .zsh, which is in mercurial.  The home dir should contain only the stub .zshenv (see .zshenv.home) to set $ZDOTDIR, and .zshrc.local.

I originally had separate branches for different machines, in order to store the .zshrc.local files too.  This turned out to be too much hassle, so never mind that.


SSH files
=========

ssh files are prototypes; they probably shouldn't be linked from the active locations, but they may be diffed
